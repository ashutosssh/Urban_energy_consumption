# 🌆 Urban Energy Consumption – Data Analysis & Insights

## 📌 Overview

This project explores patterns in **urban energy consumption** using Python-based data analysis. It focuses on identifying key trends across sectors (residential, commercial, industrial) to understand how energy is used in urban environments. The goal is to provide insights that could guide sustainable development and smart energy policy.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze urban energy usage data across various sectors.
- Identify the major consumers of energy in urban areas.
- Visualize trends in energy consumption by region and time.
- Examine correlations between consumption and urban development factors.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Visualizations

- Sector-wise energy consumption breakdown
- Time-series plots of energy use trends
- Heatmaps showing regional differences in consumption
- Correlation plots between energy use and population or income (if included)

---

## ✅ Key Insights

- Commercial and residential sectors are leading contributors to energy use.
- Seasonal variations and regional disparities influence energy patterns.
- Data-driven insights support more targeted and sustainable energy planning.

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Include additional variables like weather or income levels.
- Build a forecasting model for future consumption trends.
- Deploy as an interactive visualization dashboard with Streamlit or Dash.
